# Onboarding at Lavazza - Dave's Story â˜• ðŸ¤–

Welcome to Dave's onboarding story at "Lavazza Digital Platform Specialist". This project is a tribute page designed for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification, where Dave shares his experience of joining the company and getting started with his new role.

## User Story

Read Dave's user story in the [User Story file](https://github.com/z-bj/onboarding-at-lavazza/blob/master/User_story.md).

## Technologies Used

We used the following technologies to create this project:

-   HTML5 and CSS3 for building the website.
-   Figma for designing the UI.
-   The Airbnb "Sticky-effect" for the header navigation.
-   GitHub Pages for hosting the website.

## UI Design

I designed a responsive UI that displays well on different devices. The header navigation features the Airbnb "Sticky-effect," which enhances the user experience.

## View the Result
